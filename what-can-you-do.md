# What can you do

### Be patient
it may take just one time to leave their partner, or it may take 10. Whatever the number may be, try to stay strong for your friend and be there when she finds the courage to leave the abusive environment they are in.

### Be kind
if your friend is being abused then they most likely know very little kindness in their daily lives. Try to tell them positive aspects about themselves to boost their self-esteem and give them more confidence to be independent. 

### Don’t blame
Supporting a friend who keeps returning to a dangerous relationship can be traumatic for family and friends who may feel helpless, upset or even angry. No matter how you feel, understand that the trauma and abuse your friend experiences (as illustrated above) are the reasons they return to the relationship.  It is never the survivors’s fault, but the abuser.

If we remember these points at all times, we can be a better friend and eventually support them in leaving their abusive relationship for good or help them cope with it.
