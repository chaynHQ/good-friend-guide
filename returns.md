# If your friend returns to an abusive partner

You may find that you support a friend to remove themselves from an abusive relationship, but they end up returning to them a few months, weeks or even years later.  So we can be a good support network to a friend suffering from abuse, it is essential to understand the many factors that pull people back to a relationship that is physically or mentally harmful:

### Love
this factor may be extremely difficult for friends and family to understand. How can someone still love a partner who is abusive? The fact is that abuse rarely starts at the beginning of a relationship. Your friend will have gone through what’s called a ‘honeymoon period’ where the abuser was charming, attentive and loving. Once someone is in love it is hard to break that bond, this is especially true when the abuser is the father or mother of their children.

### Children
survivorss of abuse are often convinced by their abusive partner that they are worthless and a bad parent. They will constantly be told that if they leave they will never see their children again. Although this may not be true, abusive partners will manipulate them emotionally and mentally until they believe everything they say. Also, many people believe that keeping the family together is the best thing to avoid children growing up with just one parent, having to move schools and often move far from where they live.  

### Finance
survivorss of abuse will often be denied access to bank accounts and they are often manipulated into leaving work, meaning once they are out of the relationship they have no financial backing. This can cause people to return to their abusive partner because it is better than being homeless – again this is particularly influential with regards to children.

### Mental health issues
the trauma of physical and/or mental abuse could cause your friend mental health problems such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and depression. Your friend’s abusive partner may have used this to manipulate them, for example, they may deny them essential medication or make your friend dependent on their support.
