## How to be supportive to a friend or family member experiencing abuse.

Are you looking for practical and simple advice on how to better support a friend in an abusive relationship? We’ve put a short guide together to do just that. Though this is not a definitive resource with all the answers for each individual case, it’s a good place to start especially if you’re feeling unsure or anxious. Don’t worry! You can do this...

There is no one-size-fits-all solution so take and leave the advice you’ll find here. 

For now, we have decided to focus our attention on violent and abusive relationships in which the survivor is a woman. The relationships may be heterosexual or same-sex. Although [CHAYN’s](http://chayn.co) work is mostly aimed at women, the advice given in this guide can be used by anyone who believes it can be helpful to them, regardless of gender.
 
This guide is part of a continuing discussion about how we can support women in violent relationships. We welcome suggestions and contributions that will help us improve this guide. The guide was originally developed by Cagnesciolte in Rome and has been remixed by [CHAYN](http://chayn.co).
