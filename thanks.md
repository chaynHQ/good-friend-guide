# Many Thanks to Cagne Sciolte

This guide came about through a series of collective discussions in the ‘Cagne Sciolte’, a social centre in Rome, Italy, which runs a research centre against gender-based and same-sex violence. The Cagne Sciolte group made the decision to dedicate parts of their general assemblies and internal workshops to identify the best practices that can be used in daily life when dealing with a violent relationship. This was later remixed by many volunteers from Chayn.

It would be impossible to list all the volunteers who have helped out with the guide in some way or the other but special thanks goes to Paula, Zoe, Jenny Louise, Nooreen, Saheli, Kristin and Chayn Italia who have put a lot of effort into making this happen.
